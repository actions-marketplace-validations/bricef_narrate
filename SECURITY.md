# Security policy

## Report a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately, through
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/bricef/narrate/security/advisories/new),
not in a public issue.

Say what you found, how to reproduce it, and what someone could do with it.
A script or project that shows it helps most.

narrate is maintained by one person, on a best-effort basis, so there's no
promised response time. The report stays private while it's looked into and
fixed.

## Supported versions

Before 1.0, fixes go into `main` and the latest release only:

| Version | Gets fixes |
| --- | --- |
| `main`, and the image's `latest` tag | yes |
| the latest release | yes |
| older releases | no: update to the latest |

## Scope

narrate builds videos on your own machine. Some of what it does is by design,
and not a vulnerability:

- **The studio and the service have no login.** Anyone who can reach
  `narrate studio` or `narrate serve` can read the project's files, run builds
  and spend the ElevenLabs credits of the key it holds. Both listen on
  localhost by default: keep them there, or on a private network you trust.
  Web pages in your browser are kept out (see "Crossing into localhost"
  below).
- **Scripts reach the internet.** `render:web` fetches the pages a script
  names. HTML scenes and overlays can load from public addresses while
  they're captured; [#84](https://github.com/bricef/narrate/issues/84) tracks
  limiting them to the project's files.
- **`--allow-local-network` lets pages reach local addresses.** Given to
  `narrate build`, or `narrate serve`, or set as
  `NARRATE_ALLOW_LOCAL_NETWORK`, it lets the pages a build captures reach
  this machine and private networks. Only give it to builds whose scripts you
  trust.
- **A `.env` can set the ElevenLabs key.** narrate reads
  `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from a `.env` where it runs or beside the script, when
  it isn't set already. So a project that isn't yours can choose the key a
  build uses, unless you set your own.

What does matter, for example:

- **Escaping the project:** a ZIP project, or a request to the studio or the
  service, that reads or writes files outside its folder.
- **Captured pages:** an HTML scene, an overlay or a `render:web` capture
  that reads local files it shouldn't, or gets out of headless Chromium.
- **Reaching local addresses:** a page captured in a build that reaches
  this machine, a private network or a link-local address, without
  `--allow-local-network`, or a `narrate serve` job that turns it on for
  itself. Builds send every connection through a proxy that resolves names
  itself and refuses addresses that aren't public. A way past it is a
  vulnerability.
- **Settings from a project:** a project that isn't yours, such as a
  downloaded folder or a ZIP, setting anything else in the environment of
  narrate or the programs it runs. A `.env` sets only `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`,
  a ZIP's hidden files aren't unpacked, and `narrate serve`'s jobs read no
  `.env`, so a job takes no settings from its project. A way past these is a
  vulnerability.
- **Crossing into localhost:** a web page open in your browser that makes a
  studio or service on localhost act for it, or read what they answer. Both
  defend against this. They answer only to their own host names
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, the `--host` address and each
  `--allow-host`). They refuse a request that changes something when its
  `Origin` is another site. Their APIs send no CORS headers, and other sites
  can't frame them. A way past these is a vulnerability.
- **Pages in a project:** an HTML scene, an overlay or a slide in the
  studio's preview that makes the studio act for it, or reads what its API
  answers. The preview runs them sandboxed, each in an origin of its own, so
  they can read the project's files, as in a build, but not use the studio. A
  way past this is a vulnerability.
- **Leaking keys:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, or the credentials a `render:web`
  block names, ending up in a video, a log, an error, a cache, a response, or
  the published image.

If you're not sure, report it privately anyway.
